## mobile charger
First, it converts AC to DC then again back to AC and finally to DC.
normal charger circuit that converts 220V AC to 5V DC.There are diodes, capacitors, transistors, resistors, transformers and an optocoupler. Also, there are resistors below the PCB. Once the power is on, it turns on
# Application
.
Diodes only allow current to flow in one direction. In first half cycle of AC diode D2 & D3 are forward biased and D1 and D4 are reversed biased, and in the second half cycle (negative half) Diode D1 and D4 are forward biased and D2 and D3 are reversed biased. This Combination converts the negative half cycle into positive.
# AC to DC conversion 
## pn junction diode
Diodes only allow current to flow in one direction. In first half cycle of AC diode D2 & D3 are forward biased and D1 and D4 are reversed biased, and in the second half cycle (negative half) Diode D1 and D4 are forward biased and D2 and D3 are reversed biased. This Combination converts the negative half cycle into positive.
 4 pn juction diodes as rectifier.Rectification is the process of removing the negative part of the Alternate Current (AC), hence producing the partial DC
 220V 50Hz AC comes as input. a bridge rectifier, it converts AC to fluctuating DC
  fluctuating DC filters from the capacitor and becomes almost pure DC
## filter capacitor
   The input filter capacitor smooths out the ripples and
   provides a more stable DC voltage to the voltage regulator chip
